# PayUI - Material UI demo

Welcome to my demonstrational React & Material UI application where I show the basic usage of the [MUI (Material UI) library](https://mui.com/material-ui/) as well as common responsive UI development principles!

## Features

The application contains the following:

1. Dark mode
2. 100% responsive (minimal supported screen width is 320px)
3. Basic usage of Material UI components
4. Theming
5. Conventional files & folders structuring of the React app

## Usage

The application is powered on the [Create React App platform](https://create-react-app.dev/), thus it complies to the CRA general usage instructions.

To run the application on your localhost you should do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to the contained folder
3. Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`
5. The application will be automatically opened on `localhost:3000` in your default browser

## Reference

The application was developed based on this free design template:
